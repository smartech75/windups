# windups

A typewriter effect library for React.

Apply the typewriter (or, ahem, "windup") effect to:

- strings
- anything you can put in React's children prop!

Use the API to:

- Control the pacing of your windups
- Trigger animations, sounds or any effect you can think of!
- Intelligently handle line breaking in text!

Examples, API docs, and guides can all be found at [the docs site](https://windups.gwil.co)!
